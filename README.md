A Facilities & Equipment Maintenance Application

Inspiration and Development

While working at a company that owns and operates gas stations as its core business, I noticed that the maintenance process for fuel dispensing equipment, civil works, and other site-related issues lacked structure and automation. Gas station managers would call or email maintenance team to report issues, and there was no clear system to track, prioritize, or resolve these requests. As a result, some maintenance tasks remained unattended for long periods due to oversight or lack of follow-up.
To address this challenge, I have developed a ServiceNow application designed to streamline and automate the entire maintenance request process. The application allows gas station managers to log maintenance requests for a given site(gas station) and the application moves the request through review and approval stages until its resolved and closed. This system eliminates the risk of forgotten tasks, enhances accountability, and improves overall operational efficiency. In addition, the application offers a visualization dashboard that can be used to analyze maintenance trends for proper planning and overall management decision making.
